                        and fixed on a maid outfit with extra frills and cat ears and tail,

                        muscular, rock hard set of abs and love. He fell, his feet flying in the
                        air, fat dumpy hitting the ground like a bomb against the earth. (A/N:
                        the sound was loud bc hes made of metal and emtal is loud on the cold

                        casting a shadow (A/N: OMG SHADOW THE HEDGEHOG!!!! XDDDD) over him.
